iPlantified uses location based care suggestions tailored to your climate so if you are living in an apartment in the NT you won't be getting the same care as a house in Hobart.
We take into account the watering, light, soil composition, temperature, humidity and fertilisation rates when your plant plan is created,
with the option to customise your watering schedules to fit your needs.
