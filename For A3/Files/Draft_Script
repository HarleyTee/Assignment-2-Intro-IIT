Are you sick and tired of your plants looking like a they were left in the oven?

Do you find that your home is lacking a certain natural

Do you spend hundreds of dollars at Bunnings buying numerous plants that are destined for the bin?
Do you look around your apartment in despair ashamed to invite your friends over.

Then we have the app for you.

“iPlantified” by the Transistor Team will make sure that your plants never go un-watered again.
With our application you can be sure to never neglect your plants again.
We use a system of notifications and individualised databases to create a plant care solution for your home.

iPlantified uses location based care suggestions tailored to your climate so if you are living in an apartment in the NT you won't be getting the same care as a house in Hobart.
We take into account the watering, light, soil composition, temperature, humidity and fertilisation rates when your plant plan is created,
with the option to customise your watering schedules to fit your needs
